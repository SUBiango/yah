## Core Principles

### I. Security-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Access codes MUST be cryptographically secure (8-12 alphanumeric characters, randomly generated).
One-time use enforcement MUST be implemented at database level with atomic operations.
All user data MUST be validated server-side with sanitization before storage.
Email transmission of QR codes MUST use secure mail services with TLS encryption.

**Rationale**: Youth event registration handles sensitive personal data and payment validation. Security breaches could compromise participant privacy and organizational trust.

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All features MUST follow TDD: Write tests → Tests fail → Implement → Tests pass.
Contract tests MUST verify API endpoints match specifications exactly.
Integration tests MUST cover complete user flows (code validation → registration → QR generation).
Performance tests MUST validate response times under load (target: <500ms for form submission).

**Rationale**: Registration system has zero tolerance for data loss or validation failures. TDD ensures reliability and catches edge cases in code validation logic.

### III. User Experience Consistency
Frontend MUST maintain consistent Bootstrap theming across all registration flows.
Form validation MUST provide immediate, clear feedback for each field.
Error messages MUST be user-friendly and actionable (not technical stack traces).
Mobile-responsive design MUST work seamlessly on devices commonly used by youth.

**Rationale**: Target audience includes diverse technical skill levels. Consistent, accessible UX ensures maximum event participation and reduces support overhead.

### IV. Performance & Scalability Standards
Database queries MUST be optimized with proper indexing on access codes and email fields.
QR code generation MUST complete within 2 seconds of form submission.
Email delivery MUST be asynchronous to prevent form timeout.
Admin dashboard MUST handle 1000+ registrations without performance degradation.

**Rationale**: Event registration often experiences traffic spikes near deadlines. Poor performance could result in lost registrations and frustrated participants.

### V. Code Quality & Maintainability
All functions MUST have single responsibility with clear naming conventions.
Database schemas MUST be documented with clear field purposes and constraints.
Configuration MUST be externalized (environment variables, not hardcoded values).
Code MUST be formatted consistently with project linting rules enforced.

**Rationale**: Registration system will be maintained by different developers over time. Clear, readable code reduces onboarding time and prevents configuration errors in production.

## Data Protection & Privacy

### Personal Information Handling
All participant data MUST be stored with minimal required fields only.
Access codes MUST be hashed or encrypted in database storage.
Admin access MUST be logged with timestamps and actions taken.
Data retention policy MUST comply with youth privacy regulations and organizational policies.

### Email Communications
Registration confirmations MUST include clear unsubscribe options.
QR code emails MUST be sent from verified organizational domain.
Email templates MUST be tested across major providers (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo).
Failed email delivery MUST trigger admin notifications for manual follow-up.

## Development Workflow

### Code Review Requirements
All registration-related code MUST be reviewed by at least one other developer.
Security-sensitive components (access code validation, QR generation) MUST have additional security review.
Database schema changes MUST be reviewed by technical lead before deployment.
Performance-impacting changes MUST include before/after benchmarks.

### Deployment Standards
Staging environment MUST mirror production configuration for testing.
Database migrations MUST be reversible and tested on staging data.
Environment-specific configurations MUST be validated before deployment.
Rollback procedures MUST be documented and tested for critical path features.

## Governance

### Constitutional Compliance
All feature specifications MUST pass constitution review before implementation planning.
Code reviews MUST verify adherence to security, performance, and UX principles.
Testing requirements MUST be met before any registration feature deployment.
Technical debt that violates core principles MUST be tracked and prioritized for resolution.

### Amendment Process
Constitution changes require technical lead approval and team discussion.
Breaking changes to development standards require migration plan for existing code.
New principles must include clear rationale and measurable compliance criteria.
Emergency security updates may bypass normal amendment process with retrospective documentation.
