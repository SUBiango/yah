# Implementation Plan: Youth Event Registration System

**Branch**: `002-youth-event-registration` | **Date**: 2025-09-26 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-youth-event-registration/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Offline-to-online event registration system for youth in Sierra Leone. Participants purchase secure access codes offline, validate them online to unlock registration form, submit personal details, and receive unique QR codes for event entry via email and confirmation screen. Admin dashboard (passcode-protected) shows only registered participants with QR code download capability. Technical approach: vanilla HTML/CSS/JS frontend, Node.js/Express backend, MongoDB database, with Nodemailer/Zoho SMTP for emails and qrcode package for QR generation.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: JavaScript (Node.js 18+), HTML5, CSS3, ES6+
**Primary Dependencies**: Express.js, MongoDB driver, Nodemailer, qrcode npm package
**Storage**: MongoDB (access codes, participant data, registration records)
**Testing**: Jest for unit/integration tests, Supertest for API testing, Puppeteer for E2E
**Target Platform**: Web application (responsive for mobile/desktop)
**Project Type**: web (frontend + backend)
**Performance Goals**: <500ms form submission, <2s QR generation, 500+ concurrent registrations
**Constraints**: Secure access code validation, one-time use enforcement, Zoho SMTP integration
**Scale/Scope**: 1000+ event participants, simple admin interface, lightweight architecture

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Security-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- [x] Access code generation uses cryptographically secure random methods (crypto.randomBytes)
- [x] One-time use enforcement implemented at database level with atomic operations (findOneAndUpdate)
- [x] All user inputs validated and sanitized server-side (express-validator middleware)
- [x] Email transmission uses secure services with TLS encryption (Nodemailer with Zoho SMTP/TLS)

### Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- [x] TDD approach planned: tests written before implementation
- [x] Contract tests specified for all API endpoints (Supertest for REST APIs)
- [x] Integration tests cover complete user flows (code validation → registration → QR)
- [x] Performance tests planned with <500ms form submission target (load testing)

### User Experience Consistency
- [x] Bootstrap theming consistency maintained across registration flows (existing CSS framework)
- [x] Immediate form validation feedback planned for each field (vanilla JS validation)
- [x] Error messages designed to be user-friendly and actionable
- [x] Mobile-responsive design validated for youth-common devices (existing responsive design)

### Performance & Scalability Standards
- [x] Database indexing strategy includes access codes and email fields (MongoDB indexes)
- [x] QR code generation designed to complete within 2 seconds (qrcode package optimized)
- [x] Email delivery planned as asynchronous to prevent timeouts (background job queue)
- [x] Admin dashboard optimized for 500+ registrations (pagination, efficient queries)

### Code Quality & Maintainability
- [x] Functions designed with single responsibility and clear naming
- [x] Database schema documented with field purposes and constraints
- [x] Configuration externalized to environment variables (.env file)
- [x] Consistent code formatting and linting rules established (ESLint, Prettier)

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure selected. Frontend extends existing vanilla HTML/CSS/JS website with new registration pages. Backend is new Node.js/Express API. Integration maintains existing site structure while adding registration system as new feature.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base template
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design artifacts:
  - From `data-model.md`: Create model classes for AccessCode, Participant, Registration
  - From `contracts/api.yaml`: Create contract tests for each API endpoint  
  - From `contracts/*.test.js`: Generate failing test implementations
  - From functional requirements: Create integration test scenarios
- Task categories aligned with constitutional principles:
  - **Security Tasks**: Access code generation, input validation, passcode protection
  - **TDD Tasks**: Contract tests, integration tests, performance tests (all must fail first)
  - **Core Implementation**: Models, services, API endpoints, database operations
  - **UX Tasks**: Frontend forms, validation feedback, responsive design
  - **Integration**: Email service, QR generation, admin dashboard

**Ordering Strategy**:
- **Phase 3.1**: Environment setup (Node.js, MongoDB, dependencies)
- **Phase 3.2**: TDD Tests First (ALL MUST FAIL before any implementation):
  - Contract tests for `/api/access-codes/validate` [P]
  - Contract tests for `/api/registrations` [P]  
  - Contract tests for `/api/admin/*` endpoints [P]
  - Integration tests for complete user flows [P]
  - Performance tests for response time requirements [P]
- **Phase 3.3**: Core Models & Services (ONLY after tests fail):
  - AccessCode model with crypto.randomBytes generation [P]
  - Participant model with validation [P]
  - Registration model with QR code linking [P]
  - Database service with atomic operations [P]
  - Email service with Zoho SMTP [P]
- **Phase 3.4**: API Implementation:
  - Access code validation endpoint with rate limiting
  - Registration submission with comprehensive validation
  - Admin authentication with passcode protection
  - Admin participant listing (registered only)
  - QR code download endpoint
- **Phase 3.5**: Frontend Integration:
  - Registration form with real-time validation [P]
  - Confirmation page with QR display [P]
  - Admin dashboard with passcode gate [P]
  - Mobile-responsive styling updates [P]
- **Phase 3.6**: Production Polish:
  - Security audit and penetration testing
  - Performance optimization and load testing  
  - Email template testing across providers
  - Environment configuration validation

**Parallel Execution Markers [P]**:
- Different file implementations can run in parallel
- Database model creation is independent across entities
- Frontend pages can be developed simultaneously  
- Contract tests are independent by endpoint
- Integration tests can be written in parallel

**Estimated Output**: 
- 45-50 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md
- Clear dependencies between TDD phases
- Constitutional compliance checkpoints
- Performance validation gates

**Dependencies & Constraints**:
- All tests MUST be written and failing before implementation
- Security-sensitive tasks require additional review gates
- Database operations must use atomic transactions
- Email integration requires Zoho credential validation
- QR code generation must maintain <2 second performance target

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
