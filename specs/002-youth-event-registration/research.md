## Technology Decisions

### Access Code Generation
**Decision**: Use Node.js `crypto.randomBytes()` for cryptographically secure access code generation
**Rationale**: 
- Built-in Node.js crypto module provides cryptographically secure random number generation
- No external dependencies required
- Meets constitutional security-first requirement
- Can generate 8-12 character alphanumeric strings with sufficient entropy
**Alternatives considered**: 
- `Math.random()` - rejected for lack of cryptographic security
- External libraries like `uuid` - rejected for unnecessary complexity
- Custom random generation - rejected for potential security flaws

### Database Operations for One-Time Use
**Decision**: MongoDB `findOneAndUpdate()` with atomic operations
**Rationale**:
- Atomic operation prevents race conditions when multiple users submit same code simultaneously  
- Built-in MongoDB operation ensures database-level consistency
- Supports conditional updates based on current document state
- Aligns with constitutional requirement for atomic operations
**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate find + update operations - rejected for race condition vulnerability
- Database transactions - rejected for added complexity in single-document operations
- Application-level locking - rejected for performance and scalability issues

### Form Validation Strategy
**Decision**: Server-side validation with `express-validator` + client-side vanilla JavaScript
**Rationale**:
- Server-side validation ensures security regardless of client manipulation
- `express-validator` provides comprehensive validation and sanitization
- Client-side validation improves user experience with immediate feedback
- No external frontend dependencies maintains lightweight architecture
**Alternatives considered**:
- Client-side only - rejected for security vulnerabilities
- Server-side only - rejected for poor user experience
- Heavy validation libraries - rejected for conflicting with lightweight requirement

### QR Code Generation
**Decision**: `qrcode` npm package with server-side generation
**Rationale**:
- Lightweight, well-maintained library with good performance
- Server-side generation ensures consistent quality and security
- Supports various output formats (PNG, SVG, base64)
- Fast generation meets <2 second performance requirement
**Alternatives considered**:
- Client-side QR generation - rejected for security and consistency concerns
- Heavy QR libraries - rejected for performance overhead
- External QR services - rejected for dependency and privacy concerns

### Email Integration
**Decision**: Nodemailer with Zoho SMTP configuration
**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing organizational Zoho email infrastructure
- Nodemailer is industry standard for Node.js email sending
- Built-in TLS support meets security requirements
- Supports attachments for QR code delivery
- Asynchronous sending prevents form timeout
**Alternatives considered**:
- SendGrid/Mailgun - rejected to avoid additional service dependencies
- Built-in SMTP - rejected for complexity and reliability concerns
- Gmail SMTP - rejected since organization uses Zoho

### Admin Authentication
**Decision**: Static passcode validation with environment variable storage
**Rationale**:
- Simple implementation without full authentication system complexity
- Environment variable storage keeps passcode out of codebase
- Server-side validation prevents client-side bypass
- Sufficient security for internal admin access
**Alternatives considered**:
- Full authentication system - rejected for over-engineering
- Client-side passcode - rejected for security vulnerability
- No authentication - rejected for security concerns

### Database Indexing Strategy
**Decision**: Compound indexes on access codes and email fields
**Rationale**:
- Index on access code field enables fast validation queries
- Email field index supports admin dashboard participant lookup
- Compound indexes optimize common query patterns
- Essential for meeting performance requirements with 500+ registrations
**Alternatives considered**:
- No indexing - rejected for performance degradation
- Single field indexes only - rejected for suboptimal query performance
- Over-indexing - rejected for storage overhead and write performance impact

### Testing Framework
**Decision**: Jest for unit/integration tests, Supertest for API testing
**Rationale**:
- Jest is Node.js standard with excellent mocking capabilities
- Supertest integrates well with Express for API endpoint testing
- Both support TDD workflow required by constitution
- No additional test runner configuration needed
**Alternatives considered**:
- Mocha/Chai - rejected for additional configuration complexity
- Built-in Node.js testing - rejected for limited features
- Heavy testing frameworks - rejected for conflicting with lightweight architecture

## Integration Patterns

### Frontend-Backend Communication
**Decision**: REST API with JSON responses
**Rationale**:
- Simple integration with existing vanilla JavaScript frontend
- Standard HTTP methods align with CRUD operations
- JSON format easy to parse without additional libraries
- RESTful design promotes maintainability
**Alternatives considered**:
- GraphQL - rejected for over-engineering simple use case
- WebSocket - rejected as real-time features not required
- Server-side rendering - rejected for conflicting with existing frontend approach

### Error Handling Strategy
**Decision**: Structured error responses with user-friendly messages
**Rationale**:
- Consistent error format enables proper frontend error handling
- User-friendly messages meet constitutional UX requirements
- Technical details logged server-side for debugging
- HTTP status codes provide semantic meaning
**Alternatives considered**:
- Generic error messages - rejected for poor user experience
- Technical error exposure - rejected for security concerns
- No structured error handling - rejected for maintenance difficulties

### Performance Optimization
**Decision**: Asynchronous email sending with background job processing
**Rationale**:
- Prevents form submission timeout during email delivery
- Maintains responsive user experience
- Enables retry logic for failed email deliveries
- Supports high-volume registration periods
**Alternatives considered**:
- Synchronous email sending - rejected for timeout risks
- External job queue services - rejected for added complexity
- No email optimization - rejected for performance requirements

## Security Considerations

### Input Sanitization
**Decision**: Server-side sanitization with whitelist validation
**Rationale**:
- Prevents XSS and injection attacks
- Whitelist approach more secure than blacklist
- Validation occurs before database storage
- Constitutional requirement for server-side validation
**Alternatives considered**:
- Client-side only sanitization - rejected for security bypass potential
- Blacklist validation - rejected for incomplete protection
- No sanitization - rejected for security vulnerabilities

### Access Code Storage
**Decision**: Hash access codes in database using bcrypt
**Rationale**:
- Prevents access code exposure in case of database breach
- bcrypt provides strong hashing with salt
- One-way hashing prevents code recovery
- Constitutional requirement for secure storage
**Alternatives considered**:
- Plain text storage - rejected for security vulnerability
- Simple hashing (MD5/SHA1) - rejected for weak security
- Encryption - rejected as codes don't need to be reversible

## Conclusion

All technology decisions align with constitutional principles:
- **Security-First**: Cryptographic access codes, atomic operations, secure email, input sanitization
- **Test-Driven**: Jest/Supertest enable comprehensive TDD workflow
- **UX Consistency**: Validation strategy maintains responsive, user-friendly experience
- **Performance**: Database indexing, async operations, optimized QR generation
- **Code Quality**: Clear patterns, environment configuration, maintainable structure
