**Feature Branch**: `002-youth-event-registration`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a simple, offline-to-online event registration system for youth in Sierra Leone. Participants buy a secure access code offline, then use it on the event registration page to unlock and submit the registration form. Once registered, they receive a unique QR code for event entry that they can screenshot or download on the confirmation page or in their email."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Feature description provided and comprehensive
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Actors: Youth participants, Event administrators
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Actions: Purchase codes offline, validate codes, register, generate QR codes
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Data: Access codes, participant information, registration records
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Constraints: Secure codes, one-time use, no online payments
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ All requirements clearly specified in feature document
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Clear user flows identified from requirements
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Requirements generated and testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Access codes, participants, registrations, QR codes identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ No implementation details, focused on business needs
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A young person in Sierra Leone wants to attend the YAH event. They purchase an access code through an offline channel (physical store, agent, etc.). They then visit the event website, enter their purchased code to unlock the registration form, fill in their personal details, and submit the form. Upon successful registration, they immediately see a confirmation screen with their registration ID and QR code, and also receive this information via email. They use the QR code at the event entrance for quick check-in.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has a valid, unused access code, **When** they enter it on the registration page, **Then** the registration form becomes enabled and submittable
2. **Given** a user completes the registration form with valid information and a valid access code, **When** they submit the form, **Then** they see a confirmation screen with registration ID and QR code, and receive a confirmation email
3. **Given** a user tries to register with an already-used access code, **When** they attempt to submit the form, **Then** they receive an error message stating the code has already been used
4. **Given** an administrator enters the correct passcode to access the admin dashboard, **When** they view the participant list, **Then** they see only registered participants with their details and QR code download options
5. **Given** a participant has lost their QR code, **When** an administrator downloads their QR code from the admin dashboard, **Then** the administrator can send the QR code to the participant
6. **Given** someone tries to access the admin dashboard without the correct passcode, **When** they attempt to view the page, **Then** they are denied access

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user enters an invalid or non-existent access code? System displays clear error message without revealing whether code exists.
- How does the system handle duplicate email addresses? System allows multiple registrations with same email (different people may share email access).
- What if email delivery fails via Zoho SMTP? System still shows confirmation screen with QR code and logs failed email for admin follow-up.
- How does the system handle incomplete form submissions? System validates all required fields and shows specific error messages for missing/invalid data.
- What if the same access code is submitted simultaneously by two users? Database ensures atomic one-time use validation to prevent double registration.
- What happens when someone tries to access the admin page without the correct passcode? System denies access and does not reveal any participant information.
- How does the system handle incorrect passcode attempts? System shows error message without revealing whether passcode exists.
- What if Zoho SMTP credentials are invalid or expired? System logs email failure and provides admin notification for credential update.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST validate access codes and only accept unused, valid codes
- **FR-002**: System MUST display registration form that cannot be submitted without a valid access code
- **FR-003**: System MUST capture participant information including full name, phone, email, age, occupation, and track of interest
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate unique QR codes for each successful registration
- **FR-005**: System MUST mark access codes as "used" immediately upon successful registration
- **FR-006**: System MUST display confirmation screen with registration ID and QR code after successful submission
- **FR-007**: System MUST send automated email confirmation with registration details and QR code using Zoho SMTP
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide admin dashboard protected by a static passcode gate
- **FR-009**: System MUST display only registered participants in admin dashboard (unused codes hidden)
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow administrators to download QR codes for registered participants
- **FR-011**: System MUST prevent registration with invalid, used, or non-existent access codes
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate all form fields including email format and required field completion
- **FR-013**: System MUST generate access codes that are cryptographically secure and difficult to guess
- **FR-014**: System MUST ensure QR codes are unique and tied to specific participant records
- **FR-015**: System MUST allow participants to download/screenshot their QR code from confirmation screen
- **FR-016**: System MUST validate admin passcode server-side before allowing dashboard access
- **FR-017**: System MUST store admin passcode securely as environment variable
